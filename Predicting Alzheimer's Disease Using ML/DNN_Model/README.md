# DNN

DNN model, consisted 2 to 5 fully-connected layers, is established. The hyperparameters, including number of layers, number of neurons of each layer and learning rate, are search automatically by HORD method. As well as FC layers, batch normalization method and Xavier initialization method are implemented in DNN model.
