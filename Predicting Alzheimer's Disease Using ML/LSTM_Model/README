The main part is defined in LSTM_Net file, including the training and test parts. The multi-layer LSTM model is defined in lstmnet.py file, which concatenate several LSTM cells. lstm_cell.py is consisted of main mathmatic equations of LSTM model. lstmcell.py is the fundamental script which can be called by lstmnet, and lstmnet is called by LSTM_net.
