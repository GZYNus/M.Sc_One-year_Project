The main part is defined in LSTM_Net file, including the training and test parts. The multi-layer LSTM model defined in lstmnet.py file, which defines the number of layers. lstm_cell.py is consisted of main mathmatic equations of LSTM model. lstmcell.py is the fundamental script which can be called by lstmnet, and lstmNET is called by LSTM_Net
